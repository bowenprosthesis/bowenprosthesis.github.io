I am a Ph.D. student at Harbin Institute of Technology, with research interests in the design and control of prosthetic and robotic systems, and gait analysis.

### *1. Design of an EHA-Driven Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis*

> Hydraulic systems are well-suited for designing highly integrated, high-load-capacity drive systems. We developed **three generations** of EHA-driven ankle-foot prostheses to improve power density and biomechanical adaptability:
  
  - [**Gen-1**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenprosthesis/bowenprosthesis.github.io/main/images/Gen-1.png): Off-board, damping-based hydraulic system  
  - [**Gen-2**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenprosthesis/bowenprosthesis.github.io/main/images/Gen-2.png): Fully active, on-board direct-drive design  
  - [**Gen-3**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenprosthesis/bowenprosthesis.github.io/main/images/AMAM_poster.png): Fully active prosthesis with hydraulic-based *Serial Elastic Actuation (SEA)*

  The evolution demonstrates a shift from passive damping to **actively controlled, biomimetic actuation**, enhancing both performance and compactness.

### *2. Study on the Biomechanical Impact of a Powered Biarticular prothetic foot*  
 > Conventional ankle-foot prostheses primarily replicate monoarticular muscle functions (e.g., Soleus, Tibialis Anterior), but often fail to capture the contributions of biarticular muscles such as the Gastrocnemius. We developed a powered prosthetic foot incorporating a cable-driven biarticular muscle actuator. Experiments with healthy participants demonstrated a reduction in metabolic cost. We analyzed potential contributing factors, including joint mechanics, center-of-mass dynamics, and gait symmetry.

### *3. User Preference-Based Human-in-the-Loop Tuning of Exoskeleton Assistance during Walking*  
 > Recent studies have demonstrated that human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization can generate individualized exoskeleton control parameters to reduce metabolic cost. However, the time-consuming nature of this process limits its practical use, particularly for older adults and patients. Meanwhile, humans have shown the ability to adapt gait to different assistance profiles over time, leading to reduced metabolic expenditure. This project investigates a user-driven, self-tuning control strategy based on subjective perception, aiming to achieve metabolic reduction without complex optimization algorithms.


### *4. Design of a Biped Walking Robot*  
 > We are developing a bipedal walking robot with full lower-limb degrees of freedom, including a 1-DoF waist joint, 3-DoF hip, 1-DoF knee, and 2-DoF ankle. This robot serves as a platform for research in humanoid locomotion, dynamic stability control, and assistive walking strategies.
