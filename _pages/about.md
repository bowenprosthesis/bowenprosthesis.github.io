<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student at Harbin Institute of Technology, with research interests in the design and control of prosthetic and robotic systems, as well as gait data analysis. Currently, my work focuses on the high-performance implementation of electro-hydraulic prostheses and the exploration of their human-machine interaction mechanisms. During my doctoral studies, I was awarded a scholarship from the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and spent one year as a visiting researcher at the Lauflabor laboratory of TU Darmstadt, where I participated in the interdisciplinary LokoAssist project.

Before entering academia, I worked as an engineer at Shenyang Machine Tool Group, where I was responsible for the development and testing of CNC systems. This industry experience provided a strong foundation for my subsequent research on complex electromechanical systems.

- Design of an EHA-Driven Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis


Supervisor: [**Qitao Huang**](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/huangqitao)
- Hydraulic systems are well-suited for designing highly integrated, heavy-load drive systems. We developed three generations of EHA-driven ankle-foot prostheses to improve power density and biomechanical adaptability. The evolution progressed from an off-board, damping-based hydraulic system (Gen-1), to a fully active, on-board direct-drive design (Gen-2), and finally to a third-generation fully active prosthesis featuring a hydraulic-based serial elastic actuation (SEA) mechanism.
