I am a Ph.D. student at Harbin Institute of Technology, with research interests in the design and control of prosthetic and robotic systems, and gait analysis. 

# üîß Projects 
### *1. Design of an EHA-Driven Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis*  
  
  > Hydraulic systems are well-suited for designing highly integrated, high-load-capacity drive systems.

  We developed **three generations** of EHA-driven ankle-foot prostheses to improve power density and biomechanical adaptability:
  
  - **Gen-1**: Off-board, damping-based hydraulic system  
  - **Gen-2**: Fully active, on-board direct-drive design  
  - **Gen-3**: Fully active prosthesis with hydraulic-based *Serial Elastic Actuation (SEA)*

  The evolution demonstrates a shift from passive damping to **actively controlled, biomimetic actuation**, enhancing both performance and compactness.


### *2. Study on the Biomechanical Impact of a Powered Biarticular prothetic foot*  
  **üè∑Ô∏è Keywords:** Hydraulic systems, EHA, SEA, Biomechanics


### *3. User Preference-Based Human-in-the-Loop Tuning of Exoskeleton Assistance during Walking*  
  **üè∑Ô∏è Keywords:** Hydraulic systems, EHA, SEA, Biomechanics


### *4. Design of a Biped Walking Robot*  
  We are developing a bipedal walking robot with full lower-limb degrees of freedom, including a 1-DoF waist joint, 3-DoF hip, 1-DoF knee, and 2-DoF ankle. This robot serves as a platform for research in humanoid locomotion, dynamic stability control, and assistive walking strategies.
